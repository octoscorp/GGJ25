## File structure

Media - for images, sound, etc

Scripts - for, you guessed it, scripts
 - Globals - things available to all scripts at all times

Scenes - for scenes
 - Components - for parts that make up scenes and get kept on a shelf

Don't be afraid to make sub-folders!

## Git

Some things may need to be added to .gitignore as the project grows.

.gitkeep files can be deleted once there is something else in the folder.


## Music
Links to beepbox songs - basically to let me go back and edit if needed
